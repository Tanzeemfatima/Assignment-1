                <p class="para">Although global poverty has more recently resumed its pre-pandemic downward trajectory,
                    between 75 million and 95 million additional people could be living in extreme poverty in 2022
                    compared to pre-COVID-19 projections, due to the lingering effects of the pandemic, the war in
                    Ukraine, and rising inflation.

                    Food inflation can have a particularly devastating impact on poor families. A typical person in a
                    low-income country spends about two-thirds of their resources on food, while the same figure for the
                    typical person in a high-income country is closer to 25%.</p>
